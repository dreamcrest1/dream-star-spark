      content: `
1. **All Sales Are Final**
   All purchases are final. We do not offer refunds under any circumstances, except as specifically mentioned in this policy.

2. **Replacement for Non-Functional Services**
   If any OTT service is not working, we will provide a replacement or an alternative OTT service of similar value.

3. **No Refund After Order or Delivery**
   Once the service is ordered, taken, or delivered, we reserve the right to refuse any kind of refund request.

4. **Warranty on Lifetime Services**
   Services labeled as "lifetime" come with a 1-year warranty. If the service stops working after the warranty period (e.g., after 1.5 years), we will not be able to offer support or replacement.

5. **Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC)**
   Some lifetime services may include an AMC (Annual Maintenance Charge) to keep our operations sustainable. The AMC will range from 25% to 30% of the original service price.

6. **Refund Eligibility**
   Refunds are only applicable if:
   - The product/service is not delivered to you.
   - The product/service is out of stock.

7. **OEM Policy Dependency**
   We are service providers, not developers or OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). Our policies may change in accordance with OEM policy updates.

8. **Mass Service Disruptions**
   In the event of mass bans or service disruptions (e.g., Prime Video, Netflix), we will provide free replacements wherever applicable.

9. **Technical Downtime Compensation**
   If a service is non-functional due to technical or backend issues, we will compensate by extending your service validity to cover the downtime experienced.

10. **Policy Updates**
    We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, based on business needs or external conditions.

11. **Affordable Pricing & Service Quality**
    As we offer services at a fraction of the original price, minor issues may occasionally occur. However, we are committed to delivering the best possible service experience and timely support.
